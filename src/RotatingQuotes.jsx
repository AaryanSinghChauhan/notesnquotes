Creativity is not a competition. Art has the power to transform, to illuminate, to educate, inspire and motivate.","You cannot use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have. Space is the breath of art. Painting imposes the duty to disregard public opinion. Art is a journey journaling. Art making exists in a world of silence.","You dream your painting and then paint your dream. Art is a line around your thoughts. The world always seems brighter when you have just made something that was not there before. Making bad art is better than making no art.","Being creative is not a hobby, it is a way of life. Art speaks where words are unable to explain. Mindset is everything. One can speak poetry just by arranging colours well. Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth.","The things you think about determine the quality of your mind. The mind takes on the colour of your thoughts. ","Only those who care about you can hear you when you are quiet. Dance with the demons and let them show you the path. Do not quit, do it.You are never the same again. Fools know everything. Raise your words instead of voice. ","You can start where you are and change the ending. The quieter you become, the more you can hear. It is not your job to be everything to everyone.","A man who is a master of patience is master of everything else. Focus on improving yourself, not proving yourself. The man who has anticipated the coming of troubles takes away their power when they arrive."];const handleClick=function(){if(count===6){setCount(0);}else{setCount(count+1);};};return(<div className="rotatingQuotes"><button onClick={handleClick}>Rotation</button><p id="carousel">{somequotes[count]}</p></div>);};
