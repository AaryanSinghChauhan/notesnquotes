function Goenka(){return(<blockquote><p>Equanimity. When one experiences truth, the madness of finding fault disappears. The authority is one's own experience of truth. Impermanent are compound things, arising and passing away. If they arise and are extinguished, their eradication brings happiness. The consequences of today are determined by the actions of the past. To change your future, alter your decisions today. Nobody causes suffering for you, you cause the suffering for yourself. If you know how not to do that, it remains peaceful and happiness happens in every situation. </p><p>कुशल् कर्म् होता रहे, मं निर्मल् रहे।यहीधर्मुप्देश्।१।</p></blockquote>);};
